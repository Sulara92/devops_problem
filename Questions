1. Identify first that the issue happen, or it just user feeling, using https://www.webpagetest.org/ to test web page response.
  Then check servers status like cpu memory disk and network, findout is it web-application problem ?
  Go to application log to find the error, if not found any error , restart the web-application
  If found the error send the error to developer to fix it asap.
  During developer working try to restart web-application and monitor.
  By the way , we should have N to N application monitoring to identify and fix the problem faster
  
2. The problem of single web server is "Single point of failure".
  We should have multiple web servers and database to keep user stage.
  Then we can have many data center to support across data center services.
      [Web app]   [Web app]                   [Web app]   [Web app]
          \           /                           \           /
           \         /                             \         /
            \       /                               \       /
           [Database]------------------------------[Database]
           
3. In all servers I will install "Telegraf" to keep statistics of resource and processes
  and use "Grafana" to monitoring and alert
